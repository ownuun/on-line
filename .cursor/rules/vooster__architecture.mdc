# Technical Requirements Document (TRD)

## 1. Executive Technical Summary
- **Project Overview**: This project aims to develop a digital online queuing system for concert and festival attendees. The system will allow users to reserve their spot in line two days before the event via a mobile app, receive real-time call notifications on the event day, and facilitate quick and convenient entry through ticket and facial recognition.
- **Core Technology Stack**: The system will primarily leverage React Native for cross-platform mobile app development, Node.js with Express for the backend API, and MongoDB for data storage. Redis will be used for real-time updates and queue management.
- **Key Technical Objectives**:
    - Minimize queuing time: Average on-site wait time below 10 minutes.
    - Enhance user satisfaction: App rating/survey satisfaction above 4.5/5.
    - Optimize operational efficiency: Reduce the number of on-site entry staff by 30%.
- **Critical Technical Assumptions**:
    - Users possess smartphones with mobile data connectivity.
    - A manual review process will be available for facial recognition failures.
    - The system must be scalable to handle potential server load and traffic spikes.

## 3. System Architecture Design

### Top-Level building blocks
- **Mobile App (React Native)**:
    - *Sub-building blocks*: UI components, state management (Redux or Context API), API client, push notification handler, face recognition module, QR code scanner.
- **Backend API (Node.js with Express)**:
    - *Sub-building blocks*: RESTful API endpoints, authentication middleware, queue management logic (Redis), database interaction layer (Mongoose), face recognition API integration, admin console API.
- **Database (MongoDB)**:
    - *Sub-building blocks*: Event data storage, user data storage, queue status storage, configuration settings.
- **Real-time Updates (Redis)**:
    - *Sub-building blocks*: Queue status updates, notification triggers, session management.
- **Face Recognition API (Cloud Vision API)**:
    - *Sub-building blocks*: Image analysis, face detection, comparison with stored user images.
- **Admin Console**:
    - *Sub-building blocks*: TO settings, call management, monitoring dashboard.

```

- **Mobile App to Backend API**: The mobile app communicates with the backend API via HTTP requests for user authentication, event data retrieval, queue registration, and real-time updates.
- **Backend API to Database**: The backend API interacts with MongoDB to store and retrieve event data, user information, and queue status.
- **Backend API to Redis**: The backend API uses Redis for real-time queue management, session management, and notification triggers.
- **Backend API to Face Recognition API**: The backend API uses Face Recognition API for user face verification during the entry process.
- **Admin Console to Backend API**: The Admin Console communicates with the backend API via HTTP requests for TO settings and call management.

### Code Organization & Convention
**Domain-Driven Organization Strategy**
- **Domain Separation**: Organize code by business domains/bounded contexts (e.g., `user`, `event`, `queue`, `notification`, `admin`).
- **Layer-Based Architecture**: Separate concerns into distinct layers (presentation, business logic, data access, infrastructure).
- **Feature-Based Modules**: Group related functionality together rather than separating by technical concerns
- **Shared Components**: Common utilities, types, and reusable components in dedicated shared modules

### Data Flow & Communication Patterns
- **Client-Server Communication**: The mobile app sends HTTP requests to the backend API for all data operations. The backend API responds with JSON data.
- **Database Interaction**: The backend API uses Mongoose ORM to interact with MongoDB. Data is stored and retrieved using asynchronous operations.
- **External Service Integration**: The backend API integrates with the Face Recognition API via HTTP requests. API keys and authentication are managed securely.
- **Real-time Communication**: Redis Pub/Sub is used for real-time updates. When queue status changes, the backend API publishes messages to Redis channels. The mobile app subscribes to these channels to receive updates.
- **Data Synchronization**: Data consistency is maintained through transactional operations in MongoDB and optimistic locking strategies where appropriate.

## 4. Performance & Optimization Strategy
- **Database Indexing**: Optimize MongoDB query performance by creating appropriate indexes on frequently queried fields.
- **Caching**: Implement caching at various levels (e.g., Redis for frequently accessed data, HTTP caching for static assets) to reduce database load and improve response times.
- **Connection Pooling**: Use connection pooling for database connections to minimize connection overhead.
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute traffic across multiple backend API instances using a load balancer (e.g., Nginx) to ensure high availability and scalability.

## 5. Implementation Roadmap & Milestones
### Phase 1: Foundation (MVP Implementation)
- **Core Infrastructure**: Set up cloud infrastructure (AWS/GCP/Azure), configure database and Redis instances, deploy basic backend API.
- **Essential Features**: Implement user authentication, online queue registration, basic push notifications, and ticket upload functionality.
- **Basic Security**: Implement JWT authentication, input validation, and basic protection against common web vulnerabilities.
- **Development Setup**: Set up development environment, CI/CD pipeline for automated builds and deployments.
- **Timeline**: 8 weeks

### Phase 2: Feature Enhancement

## 6. Risk Assessment & Mitigation Strategies
### Technical Risk Analysis
- **Technology Risks**: Complexity of integrating face recognition API, potential performance issues with real-time updates.
    - **Mitigation Strategies**: Thoroughly test face recognition integration, optimize Redis configuration, and implement load shedding mechanisms.
- **Performance Risks**: Scalability issues during peak traffic, database bottlenecks.
    - **Mitigation Strategies**: Implement auto-scaling for backend API instances, optimize database queries, and use caching.
- **Security Risks**: Vulnerabilities in authentication and authorization mechanisms, potential for data breaches.
    - **Mitigation Strategies**: Conduct regular security audits, implement strong password policies, and encrypt sensitive data.
- **Integration Risks**: Third-party API dependencies and failure points.
    - **Mitigation Strategies**: Implement fallback mechanisms, monitor API availability, and have alternative solutions ready.

### Project Delivery Risks
- **Timeline Risks**: Delays in development due to technical challenges or resource constraints.
    - **Contingency Plans**: Prioritize critical features, allocate additional resources, and adjust project scope if necessary.
- **Resource Risks**: Lack of skilled developers with experience in React Native, Node.js, and MongoDB.
    - **Contingency Plans**: Provide training for existing team members, hire external consultants, and outsource development tasks.
- **Quality Risks**: Code quality issues, lack of thorough testing.
    - **Contingency Plans**: Implement code reviews, automate testing, and allocate sufficient time for quality assurance.
- **Deployment Risks**: Issues with production deployment and environment configuration.
    - **Contingency Plans**: Use infrastructure-as-code tools, automate deployment processes, and have a rollback plan in place.
